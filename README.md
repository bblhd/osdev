What
---
This is my operating system, its not very good yet, but I am trying to fix that. 

It might be a bit silly and idiosyncratic sometimes. 

Also my custom build script mightn't be very robust, so yeah (as in it might not work (but it works on my machine)). You may wonder why I didn't just use make.

Glossary

* ktao stands for Kernel Terminal Area Output, which replaced an older system of mine misleadingly called kio (Kernel Input Output), ultimately replacing one duality with another
