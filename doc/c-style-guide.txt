C style guide for operating system

- Expressions/statements that are spread over multiple lines
	should have some part of them on the previous line (for example, opening bracket)

- Closing brackets should always be on their own line,
	with the exception of trailing commas, semicolons, and preceding whitespace

- Indents should almost always be used between brackets,
	and should always use the tab character
	
- If a line is visually 'too long' it should be spread over multiple lines
	
- Always prefer a medium level density over sparse code
	
- Prefer short useful inline comments over large explainatory block comments

- Prefer to have long code near the end rather than the beginning


examples of reasonable for statements given these rules
(this isnt a complete reference, just an idea of what my coding style looks like):
	
	for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) printf("%i\n", i);
	
	for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
		printf("%i\n", i);
	}
