Goals for this operating system:

- Run on my Aspire One i868 notebook
- Have a system I understand in its entirety
- Ideal End goal: have functional graphical text editor with keyboard and mouse controls,
	a tiling windows manager, and some kind of interactive shell (text-based or graphical)
- Idealest End goal (slightly unrealistic): use it as my daily programming driver

Negative goals (things I am not trying to do or that can be done later):

- Run preexisting software on it
- Emulate windows, linux, or mac
- Network connectivity
- POSIX/UNIX compatibility

Methodologies (the manner with which I want to achieve my goals):

- Follow a microkernel design
- KIS and 'Worse is Better' (what the suckless people like)
